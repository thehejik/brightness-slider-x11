# Brightness Slider Extension for GNOME Shell on X11

This GNOME Shell extension adds a brightness slider to the top panel, allowing you to easily adjust the screen brightness of your connected displays. It also includes a dropdown menu to select the display you want to control, making it ideal for multi-monitor setups.

## Features

- **Brightness Control**: Adjust the brightness of your screen(s) using a convenient slider.
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Select which display to control from a dropdown menu.
- **Minimum Brightness Protection**: Prevents brightness from being set below 15% to avoid screen visibility issues.

## Requirements

- `xrandr` command-line tool (usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions)
